### My Portfolio...refactored for Next JS

Previously on React JS...

I ran a website based on [this repo](https://github.com/aagb1884/portfolio) from Github Pages. I had been advised to try Next JS, and had an opportunity to practice it at work. Around the same time I had added a blog to my website and was looking into generating an RSS Feed for it. The time had come to update, for a variety of reasons ([all handily summarised in this blog post](https://andrewblair.co.uk/blog/converting-this-website-from-react-to-next-js)) and so now my website is Next JS, increasingly written in Typescript, and hosted on Vercel.

I'm not sure if it's that much faster - as I was converting from React JS I had to use client for most of the components - but it's much better for metadata and social media links, and allowed me to set up an RSS Feed. One day I'll get the hang of ESLint and stop having to make three commits per update, but today is not that day.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).
